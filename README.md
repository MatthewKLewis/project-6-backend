# "All Business" Problem Ticket API

## Users:
- Dispatchers - administrators that assign tickets to...
- Fixers - workers that solve problems for...
- Users - clients of the application service

## Tickets:
- Title
- Description of the Problem
- Dates: createdOn, assignedOn
- Keywords

  - Testing.
